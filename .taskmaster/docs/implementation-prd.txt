- Add progress aggregation and reporting system
- Implement result merging and artifact management
- Create task graph analysis algorithms
- Set up worker health monitoring and failover
- Implement concurrent execution with rate limiting
- Add WebSocket support for real-time progress streaming
- Create pluggable task decomposition strategies

#### Core Features Implementation
- Smart task splitting based on complexity analysis
- Dynamic worker scaling and assignment algorithms
- Conflict resolution for overlapping changes
- Rollback mechanisms for failed executions
- Comprehensive orchestration engine

### Phase 4: MCP Server Implementation (Weeks 4-5)

#### Package 5: @claudecluster/mcp
- Implement full Model Context Protocol compliance
- Create Claude Code integration and authentication
- Build request routing and load balancing
- Add session management and state persistence
- Implement real-time communication with WebSockets
- Set up Redis integration for session storage
- Create JWT-based authentication system
- Generate OpenAPI specification and validation
- Replace mock coordination with production server
- Implement comprehensive API security

### Phase 5: CLI Interface (Weeks 5-6)

#### Package 6: @claudecluster/cli
- Create comprehensive command-line interface using Commander.js
- Implement project initialization and configuration
- Build task submission and monitoring commands
- Add worker management functionality
- Create result visualization and reporting
- Set up CI/CD pipeline integration
- Add interactive prompts with Inquirer.js
- Implement progress bars and real-time updates
- Create export formats (JSON, Markdown, HTML)
- Build configuration file management system

#### CLI Commands Implementation
- claudecluster init [project] - Initialize project with templates
- claudecluster run "goal" [options] - Execute parallel tasks
- claudecluster workers [list|add|rm] - Manage worker instances
- claudecluster status [task-id] - Check execution status
- claudecluster logs [task-id] - View detailed logs
- claudecluster export [format] - Export results and reports

## Quality Standards and Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- TypeScript strict mode with 100% type coverage
- Jest testing framework with >90% test coverage
- ESLint with TypeScript rules and Prettier formatting
- JSDoc documentation with Typedoc generation
- Security scanning with Snyk and OWASP compliance
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- OpenTelemetry integration for observability

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Docker Compose for local multi-service testing
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with parallel job execution
- Google Cloud Run for scalable worker deployment
- OpenTelemetry with Prometheus metrics collection
- Cloud storage integration for artifacts and logs
- Redis for session and state management

### Performance Targets
- Support 2-20 concurrent workers efficiently
- Achieve 3x speedup vs sequential execution
- Maintain 99.5% successful task completion rate
- Response time <500ms for task submission
- Status update response time <2s

### Success Metrics
- Execute parallel Claude Code tasks across multiple workers
- Handle complex task dependencies and execution ordering
- Aggregate results from multiple workers coherently
- Provide real-time progress updates and comprehensive logging
- Support various task types (code generation, refactoring, testing)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- Claude Code integration complexity - extensive mock testing
- Task coordination race conditions - event-driven architecture
- Performance degradation at scale - comprehensive load testing
- Memory leaks in long-running processes - resource monitoring

### Business Risks
- Claude Code API changes - abstract interface layer
- Resource consumption issues - configurable limits and monitoring
- Security vulnerabilities - comprehensive security scanning
- Integration complexity - progressive integration approach

## Implementation Timeline
Total Duration: 8 weeks
- Phase 1: Core Foundation (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Worker Implementation (2 weeks) 
- Phase 3: Driver Implementation (2 weeks)
- Phase 4: MCP Server (1 week)

## Development Workflow
1. Package-first development with independent testing
2. Progressive integration at phase boundaries
3. Continuous deployment to staging environment
4. Quality gates at each milestone
