Enhanced configuration system with PTY-specific schema for claudeCliPath, ptyTimeoutMs, and maxConcurrentProcesses. Implemented ExecutionFactory pattern for auto-detection and runtime switching between executor types. Updated task execution service with factory-based initialization and maintained backward compatibility. Added PTY control endpoints (/pty/status, /pty/switch) for monitoring and runtime mode switching.
