The Session interface enables comprehensive session management with fields for tracking session ID, executor reference, timestamps, status, and metadata.\n\nThe TaskContextFromSession utility type and CreateSessionTaskInput interface facilitate session-aware task creation, while the TaskSessionHelpers namespace provides conversion functions between session options and task contexts. All components are properly validated through comprehensive Zod schemas (SessionOptionsSchema, SessionSchema, CreateSessionTaskInputSchema).\n\nThe integration maintains compatibility with the existing TaskContext structure, with SessionOptions fields mapping directly to TaskContext fields and proper unit conversions handled by helper functions.
