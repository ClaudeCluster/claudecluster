# Overview

ClaudeCluster is an open-source orchestration framework that transforms Claude Code into a scalable, parallel coding cluster. The system enables a single Driver instance to coordinate multiple Worker instances running Claude Code sessions in parallel, distributing coding tasks (scaffolding, refactoring, testing, documentation) and aggregating results for accelerated software development.

The framework solves the problem of sequential task execution limitations in AI-assisted development by enabling parallel execution of independent tasks, dramatically reducing time-to-delivery for complex projects. It targets development teams and organizations looking to scale their AI-assisted development workflows while maintaining transparency, control, and enterprise-grade security.

# Core Features

## Driver Orchestration Engine
The Driver is the central coordinator that receives high-level goals and orchestrates task execution across multiple Workers.
- Task graph planning and dependency resolution
- Dynamic worker allocation and load balancing
- Real-time progress aggregation and monitoring
- Artifact collection and consolidation
- Retry logic and failure handling
- Token budget management across workers

## Worker Execution Framework
Workers are isolated Claude Code instances that execute specific tasks assigned by the Driver.
- Isolated execution environments for task safety
- Streaming progress updates to Driver
- Artifact generation (diffs, files, test results)
- Resource usage monitoring and reporting
- Graceful failure handling and recovery
- Support for different runtime environments (local, Docker, K8s)

## Task Management System
A comprehensive system for defining, scheduling, and tracking coding tasks.
- Task definition with clear inputs/outputs
- Dependency graph construction
- Priority-based scheduling
- Deduplication of similar tasks
- Map/reduce patterns for parallel operations
- Task result caching and reuse

## Communication Protocol
Standardized communication between Driver and Workers for coordination.
- JSON-RPC based messaging protocol
- WebSocket connections for real-time streaming
- Event-driven architecture for progress updates
- Structured logging format
- Error propagation and handling
- Health checks and heartbeat monitoring

## CLI Interface
Command-line tool for interacting with ClaudeCluster.
- Initialize and configure clusters
- Submit tasks and monitor progress
- Retrieve artifacts and logs
- Manage worker pools
- Debug and troubleshoot issues
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

# User Experience

## Developer Persona
Software engineers and DevOps teams who want to accelerate development using AI assistance at scale. They need transparency into task execution, control over resource usage, and integration with existing development workflows.

## Key User Flows
1. **Task Submission**: Developer submits a high-level goal → Driver plans task graph → Workers execute in parallel → Results aggregated
2. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time streaming of logs → Visual task graph updates → Artifact preview as generated
3. **Result Integration**: Completed artifacts reviewed → Git commits/PRs created → CI/CD pipeline triggered

## UI/UX Considerations
- CLI-first design for developer workflows
- Optional web dashboard for visual monitoring
- Structured output formats for tool integration
- Clear error messages and debugging information
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
