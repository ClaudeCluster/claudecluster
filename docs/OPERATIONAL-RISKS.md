- **Low (2)**: 5-15% likelihood in 12 months  
- **Medium (3)**: 15-40% likelihood in 12 months
- **High (4)**: 40-70% likelihood in 12 months
- **Very High (5)**: > 70% likelihood in 12 months

**Impact Levels:**
- **Very Low (1)**: Minimal impact, quick recovery
- **Low (2)**: Limited impact, recovery within hours
