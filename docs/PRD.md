## Implementation Strategy

### Development Workflow

1. **Package-First Development**
   - Each package developed independently with its own tests
   - Integration tests added after individual packages are stable
   - Mock implementations used for dependencies during development

2. **Progressive Integration**
   - Start with core types, build up dependencies
   - Integration testing at each phase boundary
   - Continuous deployment to staging environment

3. **Quality Gates**
   - 90%+ test coverage per package
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - Security scanning with Snyk
   - Performance benchmarking

### Technical Standards

- **TypeScript:** Strict mode, composite projects
- **Testing:** Jest with ts-jest, E2E with Playwright
- **Linting:** ESLint with TypeScript rules
- **Formatting:** Prettier with consistent config
- **Documentation:** JSDoc + Typedoc generation
- **Security:** OWASP compliance, dependency scanning

### Infrastructure Requirements

- **Local Development:** Docker Compose for multi-service testing
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with parallel job execution
- **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run for scalable workers
- **Monitoring:** OpenTelemetry with Prometheus metrics
- **Storage:** Cloud storage for artifacts and logs

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- âœ… Execute parallel Claude Code tasks across multiple workers
- âœ… Handle task dependencies and execution ordering
- âœ… Aggregate results from multiple workers into coherent output
- âœ… Provide real-time progress updates and logging
- âœ… Support various task types (code generation, refactoring, testing)

### Performance Targets
- **Scalability:** Support 2-20 concurrent workers
- **Throughput:** 3x faster than sequential execution for parallelizable tasks
- **Reliability:** 99.5% successful task completion rate
- **Response Time:** <500ms for task submission, <2s for status updates

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage:** >90% across all packages
- **Type Safety:** 100% TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **Documentation:** Complete API documentation with examples
- **Security:** Zero critical vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Claude Code Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing with mock Claude Code processes
   - Fallback: Maintain mock implementation for development

2. **Task Coordination Race Conditions**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive concurrency testing
   - Solution: Event-driven architecture with proper synchronization

3. **Performance at Scale**
   - Mitigation: Load testing with realistic workloads
   - Monitoring: Real-time performance metrics and alerting

### Business Risks
1. **API Changes in Claude Code**
   - Mitigation: Abstract interface layer with version detection
   - Strategy: Maintain compatibility with multiple Claude Code versions

2. **Resource Consumption**
   - Mitigation: Resource limits and monitoring
   - Controls: Configurable timeouts and memory limits
