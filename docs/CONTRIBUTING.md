# Contributing to ClaudeCluster

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is in active developmentâ€”design input, docs, and small focused improvements are especially valuable.

## Code of Conduct

By participating, you agree to uphold a respectful, inclusive environment. Be kind, constructive, and considerate.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to confirm that contributions are made with the right to submit them. Each commit must be signed off.

- To sign off a commit:
  - Add `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>` to the commit message, or
  - Use the `-s` flag with git: `git commit -s -m "feat: add X"`

Your sign-off certifies the DCO at https://developercertificate.org/

## How to contribute

1. Open an Issue to discuss ideas, bugs, or features
2. For larger changes, start with an RFC Issue to converge on design
3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch from `develop`
4. Make focused changes with clear rationale and ensure docs are updated
5. Use conventional commits (see below) and sign all commits with DCO
6. Submit a PR to merge your feature branch into `develop`
7. Address review feedback and ensure all status checks pass

## Branch workflow

We use a **develop/main** branching strategy with strict protection rules:

- **`develop`** (default): Integration branch for new features and changes
- **`main`**: Stable branch for releases, merged from develop

**All changes require:**
- Pull request with 1+ reviewer approval
- Passing status checks (lint, security scan, file structure)
- Code owner review (when applicable)
- DCO sign-off on all commits

**No direct pushes allowed** - this applies to all contributors including maintainers.

## Conventional commits

Follow the conventional commit format:

- `feat(scope): add new capability`
- `fix(scope): correct a bug`
- `docs(scope): update documentation`
- `chore(scope): maintenance or tooling`
- `refactor(scope): code change without behavior change`
- `test(scope): add or update tests`

Examples:

- `feat(cli): add init command`
- `docs(readme): clarify quickstart steps`

## Development setup (early-stage)

- Primary language(s): TBD (SDKs planned for TypeScript/Python)
- Runners: Local/Docker/Kubernetes (planned)
- Observability: OpenTelemetry (planned)

Until the initial CLI and SDKs land, contributions are mostly docs, design docs, and prototypes.
